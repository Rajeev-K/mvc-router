# MVC Router
A JavaScript library for building Single Page Applications (SPA) using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern.

## Install

To add MVC Router to your application:

```
npm install mvc-router-spa --save-dev
```

## Why MVC?
MVC is a proven technology that has withstood the test of time. Applications built using this pattern tend to be simpler and more maintainable.

MVC is a common and familiar pattern used by many frameworks, for building Web as well as native apps. If you are an iOS developer you may already be familiar with [MVC in Cocoa](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/CocoaEncyclopedia/Model-View-Controller/Model-View-Controller.html).

## Supports React.js
MVC Router was not specifically written for React.js --- it is independent of View technologies. However, it works very well for React applications.
